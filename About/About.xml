Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

Ah resting. Most people spend at least a third of their lives sleeping, and in Rimworld some people get to rest when they're dead. This mod adds 10 new genes that impact how efficient a pawn deathrests, with lower efficiencies increasing how long the pawn needs to rest each time. The genes multiply efficiency by 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 225%, and 250%.
